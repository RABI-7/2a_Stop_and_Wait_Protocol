# 2a_Stop_and_Wait_Protocol
## AIM 
To write a python program to perform stop and wait protocol
## ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Get the frame size from the user

4. To send frames to server from the client side.
5. If your frames reach the server it will send ACK signal to client
6. Stop the Program
